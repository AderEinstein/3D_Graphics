# 3D_Graphics Engine

A Direct3D11/C++17 3D Rendering Project.

# CheckList:
Implemented a specialized interface which creates a window with mouse and keyboard event handling using the WIN32 API.

Implemented a bindable system which manages the binding of components to the rendering pipeline to limit the binding of those components per draw calls and per model.

Implemented z-buffering and a drawable system to render multiple 3D geometric shapes which are allowed to orbit around their center and move freely around the scene.

Implemented image loading and texture mapping.

Interfaced with ImGui Library to spawn gui windows that allow the customization of various components of the scene at runtime.

Implemented a Camera object to navigate the scene.

# In progress:
