# 3D_Graphics

# Direct3D11/C++17 3D Rendering Project.

# CheckList:
Implemented a specialized interface which creates a window with mouse and keyboard event handling using the WIN32 API.
Implemented a bindable system which manages the binding of components to the rendering pipeline to limit the binding of those components per draw calls and per model.
Implemented z-buffering and a drawable system to render multiple 3D geometric shapes which are allowed to orbit around their center and move freely around the screen.

# In progress:
Camera object
ImGui
Dynamic Lighting
